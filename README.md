### 🙄🐢: Note on “testy turtle” project name

Because project titles change all the time with revisions, rewriting,
and peer review, we used [**codename**](http://svmiller.com/codename/)
to generate an
[Ubuntu-style](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DevelopmentCodeNames)
internal-to-us project name that won’t change. The seed `53879` was
generated with random atmospheric noise at
[random.org](https://www.random.org/).

``` r
library(codename)
codename_message()
#> code name generated by {codename} v.0.4.0

codename(seed = 53879, type = "ubuntu")
#> [1] "testy turtle"
```
