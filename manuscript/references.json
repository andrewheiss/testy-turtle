  {"id":"BBCM2014","abstract":"This article examines how human rights international non-governmental organizations (hereafter HROs) can increase the level of political protest in neighboring states. Previous research suggests local activities of HROs help to generate mobilization for protests against governments. This article shows that the presence of HROs in neighboring states can be a substitute for domestic HROs; if domestic HROs are already flourishing, there will be less of a ‘neighbor’ effect. At sufficiently high levels of domestic HRO prevalence within a state, neighboring HROs help domestic HROs use institutionalized substitutes for protest mobilization strategies. Spatial econometric methods are used to test the implications of this theory. These results illuminate the role that non-governmental organizations play in these domestic political processes, and demonstrate the transnational nature of their activities.","author":[{"family":"Bell","given":"Sam R."},{"family":"Bhasin","given":"Tavishi"},{"family":"Clay","given":"K.

  {"id":"BellJones:2015","abstract":"This article challenges Fixed Effects (FE) modeling as the ‘default’ for time-series-cross-sectional and panel data. Understanding different within and between effects is crucial when choosing modeling strategies. The downside of Random Effects (RE) modeling—correlated lower-level covariates and higher-level residuals—is omitted-variable bias, solvable with Mundlak's (1978a) formulation. Consequently, RE can provide everything that FE promises and more, as confirmed by Monte-Carlo simulations, which additionally show problems with Plümper and Troeger's FE Vector Decomposition method when data are unbalanced. As well as incorporating time-invariant variables, RE models are readily extendable, with random coefficients, cross-level interactions and complex variance functions. We argue not simply for technical solutions to endogeneity, but for the substantive importance of context/heterogeneity, modeled using RE. The implications extend beyond political science to all multilevel datasets. However, omitted variables could still bias estimated higher-level variable effects; as with any model, care is required in interpretation.","author":[{"family":"Bell","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Kelvyn"}],"citation-key":"BellJones:2015","container-title":"Political Science Research and Methods","container-title-short":"Political Sci.

  {"id":"Bermeo2016","abstract":"Democratic backsliding (meaning the state-led debilitation or elimination of the political institutions sustaining an existing democracy) has changed dramatically since the Cold War. Open-ended coups d’état, executive coups, and blatant election-day vote fraud are declining while promissory coups, executive aggrandizement and strategic electoral manipulation and harassment are increasing. Contemporary forms of backsliding are especially vexing because they are legitimated by the very institutions democracy promoters prioritize but, overall, backsliding today reflects democracy’s advance and not its retreat. The current mix of backsliding is more easily reversible than the past mix and successor dictatorships are shorter-lived and less authoritarian.","author":[{"family":"Bermeo","given":"Nancy"}],"citation-key":"Bermeo2016","container-title":"Journal of Democracy","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"BlackwellGlynn:2018","abstract":"Repeated measurements of the same countries, people, or groups over time are vital to many fields of political science. These measurements, sometimes called time-series cross-sectional (TSCS) data, allow researchers to estimate a broad set of causal quantities, including contemporaneous effects and direct effects of lagged treatments. Unfortunately, popular methods for TSCS data can only produce valid inferences for lagged effects under some strong assumptions. In this paper, we use potential outcomes to define causal quantities of interest in these settings and clarify how standard models like the autoregressive distributed lag model can produce biased estimates of these quantities due to post-treatment conditioning. We then describe two estimation strategies that avoid these post-treatment biases—inverse probability weighting and structural nested mean models—and show via simulations that they can outperform standard approaches in small sample settings. We illustrate these methods in a study of how welfare spending affects terrorism.","author":[{"family":"Blackwell","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Glynn","given":"Adam N."}],"citation-key":"BlackwellGlynn:2018","container-title":"American Political Science Review","container-title-short":"Am.

  {"id":"BloodgoodTB","abstract":"Prior work suggests that government funding can encourage non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to engage in political advocacy and public policy. We challenge this finding and examine two theoretical explanations for the dampening effect of government funding on NGO lobbying. First, donors are known to discipline NGO activity via an implicit or explicit threat to withdraw funding should the organization become too radical or political. Second, NGOs with more radical political agendas are less willing to seek or accept government funding for fear this will limit or delegitimize their activities. Using data from the European Union’s Transparency Register, we find that the share of government funding in NGO budgets is negatively associated with lobbying expenditure. This effect is statistically significant and substantial, which provides a reason for concern about NGO resource dependence. Even when governments are motivated by honorable intentions, their financial assistance has the (unintended) effect of dampening NGOs’ political activity.","author":[{"family":"Bloodgood","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Tremblay-Boire","given":"Joannie"}],"citation-key":"BloodgoodTB","container-title":"European Political Science Review","container-title-short":"Eur.

  {"id":"ButheMajorMello-e-Souza:2012","abstract":"Abstract\n            A large and increasing share of international humanitarian and development aid is raised from nongovernmental sources, allocated by transnational NGOs. We know little about this private foreign aid, not even how it is distributed across recipient countries, much less what explains the allocation. This article presents an original data set, based on detailed financial records from most of the major U.S.-based humanitarian and development NGOs, which allows us for the first time to map and analyze the allocation of U.S. private aid. We find no support for the common claim that aid NGOs systematically prioritize their organizational self-interest when they allocate private aid, and we find only limited support for the hypothesis that expected aid effectiveness drives aid allocation. By contrast, we find strong support for the argument that the deeply rooted humanitarian discourse within and among aid NGOs drives their aid allocation, consistent with a view of aid NGOs as principled actors and constructivist theories of international relations. Recipients' humanitarian need is substantively and statistically the most significant determinant of U.S. private aid allocation (beyond a regional effect in favor of Latin American countries). Materialist concerns do not crowd out ethical norms among these NGOs.","author":[{"family":"Büthe","given":"Tim"},{"family":"Major","given":"Solomon"},{"family":"Souza","given":"André De Mello E"}],"citation-key":"ButheMajorMello-e-Souza:2012","container-title":"International Organization","container-title-short":"Int.

Other donor governments continue to support state management of aid, seeking to strengthen recipient states. These cross-donor differences can be attributed in large measure to different national orientations about the appropriate role of the state in public service delivery. Countries that place a high premium on market efficiency (for example, the United States, United Kingdom, Sweden) will outsource aid delivery in poorly governed recipient countries to improve the likelihood that aid reaches the intended beneficiaries of services. In contrast, states whose political economies emphasize a strong state in service provision (for example, France, Germany, Japan) continue to support state provision. This argument is borne out by a variety of tests, including statistical analysis of dyadic time-series cross-section aid allocation data and individual-level survey data on a cross-national sample of senior foreign aid officials.

  {"id":"DupuyPrakash:2018","abstract":"Foreign aid contributes to about 10% of gross domestic product (GDP) of developing countries. To distribute aid in recipient countries, Western donors increasingly rely on nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Yet, since the mid-1990s, 39 developing countries have adopted laws restricting the inflow of foreign aid to NGOs operating in their jurisdictions. In response to these restrictions, have bilateral donors reduced aid, either as a punishment or because they cannot find appropriate NGOs for aid delivery? We explore this question by examining a panel of 134 aid-receiving countries for the years 1993-2012. We find that all else equal, the adoption of a restrictive NGO finance law is associated with a 32% decline in bilateral aid inflows in subsequent years. These findings hold even after controlling for levels of democracy and civil liberties, which suggests that aid reduction responds to the removal of NGOs from aid delivery chains, and not to democracy recession.","author":[{"family":"Dupuy","given":"Kendra"},{"family":"Prakash","given":"Aseem"}],"citation-key":"DupuyPrakash:2018","container-title":"Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly","container-title-short":"Nonprof.

First we discuss best practice for an ideal aid agency and the difficulties that aid agencies face because they are typically not accountable to their intended beneficiaries. Next we consider the transparency of aid agencies and four additional dimensions of aid practice: specialization, or the degree to which aid is not framgemented among too many donors, too many countries, and too many sectors for each donor); selectivity, or the extent to which aid avoids corrupt autocrats and goes to the poorest countries; use of ineffective aid channels such as tied aid, food aid, and technical assistance; and the overhead costs of aid agencies. We compare 48 aid agencies along these dimensions, distinguishing between bilateral and multilateral ones. Using the admittedly limited information we have, we rank the aid agencies on different dimensions of aid practice and then provide one final comprehensive ranking. We present these results as an illustrative exercise to move the aid discussion forward.","author":[{"family":"Easterly","given":"William"},{"family":"Pfutze","given":"Tobias"}],"citation-key":"EasterlyPfutze2008","container-title":"Journal of Economic Perspectives","container-title-short":"J.

Between 1990 and 2003 resources for democracy programs increased by over 500 percent. Has this policy worked? Prior research has been inconclusive, relying either on case studies or on quantitative efforts that have not distinguished overall foreign assistance from democracy promotion. The authors answer this question using a new data set that includes program information for 165 countries for the years 1990–2003. The analysis distinguishes between direct and indirect causal mechanisms and employs a variety of statistical models that allow the authors to control for the unique democratization trend in each country when assessing causal effects, as well as for the potential endogeneity of U.S. democracy assistance. The analysis shows that democracy assistance does indeed have a significant impact.","author":[{"family":"Finkel","given":"Steven E."},{"family":"Pérez-Liñán","given":"Aníbal"},{"family":"Seligson","given":"Mitchell A."}],"citation-key":"FinkelPerez-LinanSeligson:2007","container-title":"World Politics","container-title-short":"World Polit.","DOI":"10.1017/s0043887100020876","ISSN":"0043-8871, 1086-3338","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",4]]},"language":"en-US","page":"404-439","title":"The Effects of U.S. Foreign Assistance on Democracy Building, 1990–2003","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1017/s0043887100020876","volume":"59"},

However, power analysis is flawed in that a narrow emphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study design. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant results can often be misleading. To help researchers address this problem in the context of their own studies, we recommend design calculations in which (a) the probability of an estimate being in the wrong direction ( Type S [ sign] error) and (b) the factor by which the magnitude of an effect might be overestimated ( Type M [ magnitude] error or exaggeration ratio) are estimated. We illustrate with examples from recent published research and discuss the largest challenge in a design calculation: coming up with reasonable estimates of plausible effect sizes based on external information.","author":[{"family":"Gelman","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Carlin","given":"John"}],"citation-key":"GelmanCarlin:2014","container-title":"Perspectives on Psychological Science","container-title-short":"Perspect.

For three decades, the Correlates of War project has served as the main supplier of reliable data used in longitudinal studies of external and internal armed conflict. The COW datasets on war use the relatively high threshold of 1,000 battle-deaths. The Uppsala dataset on armed conflict has a lower threshold, 25 annual battle-deaths, but has so far been available for only the post-Cold War period. This dataset has now been backdated to the end of World War II. This article presents a report on armed conflict based on this backdate as well as another annual update. It presents the procedures for the backdating, as well as trends over time and breakdowns for the type of conflict. It assesses the criteria for measuring armed conflict and discusses some directions for future data collection in this area.","author":[{"family":"Gleditsch","given":"Nils Petter"},{"family":"Wallensteen","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Eriksson","given":"Mikael"},{"family":"Sollenberg","given":"Margareta"},{"family":"Strand","given":"Håvard"}],"citation-key":"gleditsch2002","container-title":"Journal of Peace Research","container-title-short":"J.

  {"id":"KeeleStevensonElwert:2020","abstract":"Abstract\n            A common causal identification strategy in political science is selection on observables. This strategy assumes one observes a set of covariates that is, after statistical adjustment, sufficient to make treatment status as-if random. Under adjustment methods such as matching or inverse probability weighting, coefficients for control variables are treated as nuisance parameters and are not directly estimated. This is in direct contrast to regression approaches where estimated parameters are obtained for all covariates. Analysts often find it tempting to give a causal interpretation to all the parameters in such regression models—indeed, such interpretations are often central to the proposed research design. In this paper, we ask when we can justify interpreting two or more coefficients in a regression model as causal parameters. We demonstrate that analysts must appeal to causal identification assumptions to give estimates causal interpretations. Under selection on observables, this task is complicated by the fact that more than one causal effect might be identified. We show how causal graphs provide a framework for clearly delineating which effects are presumed to be identified and thus merit a causal interpretation, and which are not. We conclude with a set of recommendations for how researchers should interpret estimates from regression models when causal inference is the goal.","author":[{"family":"Keele","given":"Luke"},{"family":"Stevenson","given":"Randolph T."},{"family":"Elwert","given":"Felix"}],"citation-key":"KeeleStevensonElwert:2020","container-title":"Political Science Research and Methods","container-title-short":"Political Sci.

  {"id":"Lall:2016","abstract":"Political scientists increasingly recognize that multiple imputation represents a superior strategy for analyzing missing data to the widely used method of listwise deletion. However, there has been little systematic investigation of\n              how\n              multiple imputation affects existing empirical knowledge in the discipline. This article presents the first large-scale examination of the empirical effects of substituting multiple imputation for listwise deletion in political science.

The estimand is the target quantity—the purpose of the statistical analysis. Much attention is already placed on how to do estimation; a similar degree of care should be given to defining the thing we are estimating. We advocate that authors state the central quantity of each analysis—the theoretical estimand—in precise terms that exist outside of any statistical model. In our framework, researchers do three things: (1) set a theoretical estimand, clearly connecting this quantity to theory; (2) link to an empirical estimand, which is informative about the theoretical estimand under some identification assumptions; and (3) learn from data. Adding precise estimands to research practice expands the space of theoretical questions, clarifies how evidence can speak to those questions, and unlocks new tools for estimation. By grounding all three steps in a precise statement of the target quantity, our framework connects statistical evidence to theory.","author":[{"family":"Lundberg","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Johnson","given":"Rebecca"},{"family":"Stewart","given":"Brandon M."}],"citation-key":"LundbergJohnsonStewart:2021","container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"Am.

We analyze votes in the House of Representatives from 1979 to 2003 that would increase or decrease foreign aid by considering the political, economic, and ideological characteristics of legislators and their districts. To understand who supports and opposes foreign aid, we utilize theories of foreign economic policy preferences. By examining different types of aid policy, we show that domestic politics and especially the distributional consequences of economic aid can matter. The economic characteristics of a district and its left–right ideological predispositions influence support for aid in a systematic fashion over the nearly 25‐year period.

  {"id":"MontgomeryNyhanTorres:2018","abstract":"Abstract\n            In principle, experiments offer a straightforward method for social scientists to accurately estimate causal effects. However, scholars often unwittingly distort treatment effect estimates by conditioning on variables that could be affected by their experimental manipulation. Typical examples include controlling for posttreatment variables in statistical models, eliminating observations based on posttreatment criteria, or subsetting the data based on posttreatment variables. Though these modeling choices are intended to address common problems encountered when conducting experiments, they can bias estimates of causal effects. Moreover, problems associated with conditioning on posttreatment variables remain largely unrecognized in the field, which we show frequently publishes experimental studies using these practices in our discipline's most prestigious journals. We demonstrate the severity of experimental posttreatment bias analytically and document the magnitude of the potential distortions it induces using visualizations and reanalyses of real‐world data. We conclude by providing applied researchers with recommendations for best practice.","author":[{"family":"Montgomery","given":"Jacob M."},{"family":"Nyhan","given":"Brendan"},{"family":"Torres","given":"Michelle"}],"citation-key":"MontgomeryNyhanTorres:2018","container-title":"American Journal of Political Science","container-title-short":"Am.

  {"id":"MuffHeldKeller:2016","abstract":"Summary\n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    Correlated data are ubiquitous in ecological and evolutionary research, and appropriate statistical analysis requires that these correlations are taken into account. For regressions with correlated, non‐normal outcomes, two main approaches are used: conditional and marginal modelling. The former leads to generalized linear mixed models (\n                    GLMM\n                    s), while the latter are estimated using generalized estimating equations (\n                    GEE\n                    s), or marginalized multilevel regression models. Differences, advantages and drawbacks of conditional and marginal models have been discussed extensively in the statistical and applied literature, and there is some agreement that the choice of the model must depend on the question under study. Yet, there still appears to be a lot of confusion and disagreement over when to choose which model.\n                  \n                \n                \n                  We start with a review of conditional and marginal models, and the differences in the interpretation of the resulting parameter estimates. We highlight that the two types of models propagate different linear relations between the covariates and the response. Moreover, while conditional models explicitly account for heterogeneity among clustered observations, marginal models yield averages over such heterogeneities and are therefore often interpreted as population‐averaged models.\n                \n                \n                  We point out theoretically and with an example that when modelling non‐normal outcomes no unambiguous definition of a marginal model generally exists. Instead, marginal model parameters are marginal only with respect to unaccounted differences among clusters and thus depend on the fixed effects in the model. Therefore, marginal model parameters should not be loosely interpreted as population‐averaged parameters. In addition, we explain how marginal modelling is mathematically analogous to deliberately omitting covariates with explanatory power, and to deliberately introducing a Berkson measurement error into covariates. We also reiterate that marginal modelling is related to a well‐known statistical phenomenon, the Simpson's paradox.\n                \n                \n                  In most cases, therefore, we regard the conditional model as the more powerful choice to explain how covariates are associated with a non‐normal response. Still, marginal models can be useful, given that the scientific question explicitly requires such a model formulation.","author":[{"family":"Muff","given":"Stefanie"},{"family":"Held","given":"Leonhard"},{"family":"Keller","given":"Lukas F."}],"citation-key":"MuffHeldKeller:2016","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Methods Ecol.

  {"id":"PoeTate1994","abstract":"This crossnational study seeks to explain variations in governmental repression of human rights to personal integrity (state terrorism) in a 153-country sample during the eighties. We outline theoretical perspectives on this topic and subject them to empirical tests using a technique appropriate for our pooled cross-sectional time-series design, namely, ordinary least squares with robust standard errors and a lagged dependent variable. We find democracy and participation in civil or international war to have substantively important and statistically significant effects on repression. The effects of economic development and population size are more modest. The hypothesis linking leftist regime types to abuse of personal integrity rights receives some support. We find no reliable evidence that population growth, British cultural influence, military control, or economic growth affect levels of repression. We conclude by considering the implications of our findings for scholars and practitioners concerned with the prevention of personal integrity abuse.","author":[{"family":"Poe","given":"Steven C."},{"family":"Tate","given":"C.

The Persistent Power of Human Rights builds on these insights, extending its reach and analysis. It updates our understanding of the various causal mechanisms and conditions which produce behavioural compliance, and expands the range of rights-violating actors examined to include democratic and authoritarian Great Powers, corporations, guerrilla groups, and private actors.

In Russia, internationally funded human rights groups are required to register as “foreign agents.” In Egypt, scores of civil society representatives have received prison sentences for receiving international funding without the permission of the government. Earlier this year, countries as diverse as Angola, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, China, and India introduced or enacted measures restricting international funding. Around the world, countries are erecting barriers to the ability of civil society organizations to receive international funding.

  {"id":"Schielzeth:2010","abstract":"Summary\n            \n              1.\n              Linear regression models are an important statistical tool in evolutionary and ecological studies. Unfortunately, these models often yield some uninterpretable estimates and hypothesis tests, especially when models contain interactions or polynomial terms. Furthermore, the standard errors for treatment groups, although often of interest for including in a publication, are not directly available in a standard linear model.\n            \n            \n              2.\n              Centring and standardization of input variables are simple means to improve the interpretability of regression coefficients. Further, refitting the model with a slightly modified model structure allows extracting the appropriate standard errors for treatment groups directly from the model.\n            \n            \n              3.\n              Centring will make main effects biologically interpretable even when involved in interactions and thus avoids the potential misinterpretation of main effects. This also applies to the estimation of linear effects in the presence of polynomials. Categorical input variables can also be centred and this sometimes assists interpretation.\n            \n            \n              4.\n              Standardization (\n              z\n              ‐transformation) of input variables results in the estimation of standardized slopes or standardized partial regression coefficients. Standardized slopes are comparable in magnitude within models as well as between studies. They have some advantages over partial correlation coefficients and are often the more interesting standardized effect size.\n            \n            \n              5.\n              The thoughtful removal of intercepts or main effects allows extracting treatment means or treatment slopes and their appropriate standard errors directly from a linear model. This provides a simple alternative to the more complicated calculation of standard errors from contrasts and main effects.\n            \n            \n              6.\n              The simple methods presented here put the focus on parameter estimation (point estimates as well as confidence intervals) rather than on significance thresholds. They allow fitting complex, but meaningful models that can be concisely presented and interpreted. The presented methods can also be applied to generalised linear models (GLM) and linear mixed models.","author":[{"family":"Schielzeth","given":"Holger"}],"citation-key":"Schielzeth:2010","container-title":"Methods in Ecology and Evolution","container-title-short":"Methods Ecol.

Nonviolent campaigns are more likely to win legitimacy, attract widespread domestic and international support, neutralize the opponent's security forces, and compel loyalty shifts among erstwhile opponent supporters than are armed campaigns, which enjoin the active support of a relatively small number of people, offer the opponent a justification for violent counterattacks, and are less likely to prompt loyalty shifts and defections. An original, aggregate data set of all known major nonviolent and violent resistance campaigns from 1900 to 2006 is used to test these claims.

Aid has a positive impact on growth in countries with an institutionalized check on governmental power; that is, in more democratic countries. The data suggest, however, that if this is not the case, aid will be used to satisfy the government’s own non‐productive goals.

The majority of studies explaining women's legislative representation prior to 2000 focused on electoral systems, cultural considerations, and the strength of leftist political parties.
